He can open any store, he is given view rights to books present in other's store. If he goes to his own store then, he can either add new book, remove a copy of book or edit the volume and copy of book. When he enters the new book the google book id of the book is automatically extracted through google api.
Once all the copies are removed it is displayed as out of stock.
